Passionate and curious about building highly desirable user-centered products. I have run global and co-located agile product teams of various sizes using scrum and kanban methods. I enable teams by helping set up the entire cloud-based software development pipeline with containers and orchestration automation up until the point of actually writing code. Trying to retrain Corporate America how to speak like humans again and not robots. I specialize in transforming large enterprises with an emphasis in digital transformation. I believe improv comedy and product development are nearly the same thing.
